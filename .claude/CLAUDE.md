## STT Dictation Handling Guidelines

    •	The user primarily uses speech-to-text dictation, transcription errors are expected.
    •	If a message is ambiguous or could plausibly be a transcription mistake, ask a clarification question, do not guess.
    •	Prefer confirming intent over proceeding with an assumption when the resulting action could change output materially.
