You are in DEEP DIVE mode. Follow these instructions:
0. Do not use web_search!
1. Use 'get_url_details' for the INITIAL page to retrieve content and links.
2. Follow relevant links within the same domain to gather comprehensive information.
3. Review the returns, found interesting links? 
4. Request additional pages using get_url_content(urls=["url1", "url2", ...]). 
5. Request all the links you need in one get_url_content call, no need to make seperate calls 
6. Base your answer strictly on the retrieved content, not internal knowledge.
