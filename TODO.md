# TODO


  
- [ ] In session history command we output a nicely formatted
 table but for normal history it is still using old simpler uglier table and actually currently it's even broken it works but it looks weird so please update history output history command
 just like session history you display as much as possible data from the table that is relevant to list of individual messages.

 - [] I want to introduce a custom tool for making get or post request to any URLs.
